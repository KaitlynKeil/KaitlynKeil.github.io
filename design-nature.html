  	<h2> Context </h2>
    <p> This was the final project for a first semester course at Olin College of Engineering called Design Nature. During this class, students get familiar with the idea of bio-inspiration for design and create rapid prototypes for a given prompt.</p>
  	<p> Our goal was to come up with a play experience based on dragons and cats. Very quickly, we determined that we wanted to involve wearable wings for the fourth graders that could extend and retract. After several prototypes and a lot of discussion about materials, we settled on three-ply cardboard as a light-weight base, covered with fabric to catch the wind.</p>

  	<h2> Project Outcome </h2>
  	<p> Our game became one where children wearing the wings would help steer a ping-pong ball down a track, mimicking a cat in a boat. The children would use the wind from their wings to navigate down the proper route. Everyone loved the wings we produced, though we were informed that "Dragons don't exist" as a cutting critique.</p>
