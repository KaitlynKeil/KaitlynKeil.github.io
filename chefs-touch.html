  	<h2> Context </h2>
  	<p> Chef's Touch was the main project for a design depth course, Technology, Accessibility, and Design. I took this class during the spring semester of my junior year at Olin College of Engineering.</p>
  	<p> Over the course of this project, we worked with Brian Charlson, Director of Technology at <a href="http://carroll.org/">Carroll Center for the Blind</a>, an amateur chef with a passion for accessible tools and trying new things. With his expert advice and co-design help, we worked towards implementing an accessible recipe repository that would work with screen readers.</p>

  	<h2> Project Outcome </h2>
  	<p> <a href="http://chefstouch.herokuapp.com">Chef's Touch</a> is a functional web app, to which users can add recipes and search those added. Formatting that would be difficult for a screen reader (such as the unicode for one half) to parse is converted to a more understandable format in any occurance, and cooking tips are linked where they are most relevant. These features are in response to multiple design sessions we had with Brian Charlson.</p>
  	<p> Due to its nature as a community created and curated repository, Chef's Touch is still very small and has not undergone mass uptake. Several of the members on the team still hope to return to it and fix the remaining bugs.</p>

  	<h2> My Role </h2>
  	<p> As this class was a design depth, I took an equal part in coming up with the project and speaking with our primary user. I was also one of the two main technical leads, focused on the back end of the web app.</p>
  	<p> Working on the back end of this project, I primarily worked with accepting and processing user input to make it ready for display, then storing it in the database for later retrieval. Though I came into this project with only minor experience with queries and minimal web development experience, I took the primary role in constructing the search page, input processing, and database structure. </p>

    <h2> Primary Technologies </h2>
    <p> This project was written in Python, with a layer of HTML/CSS. We used Flask and Heroku to construct the website, and the recipes were stored in a mongoDB through MongoAlchemy.</p>

  	<h2> Take-Aways </h2>
  	<p>This project gave me a much firmer grasp on accessible design, as well as user-oriented design in general. It also helped me better understand how a web app functions and what would go into making more such projects in the future.</p>
